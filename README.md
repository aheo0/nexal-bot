# nexal-bot
The nexal bot is a Discord bot coded in Python to serve as Security for RotMG Discord servers. The bot parses for crahsers and raiders not meeting requirements, which can be modified to parse for different equipment, stats, and mHeal each time. The equipment, stats, and mHeals are all web-scraped from the official https://www.realmeye.com/ website.
